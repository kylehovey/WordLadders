# WordLadders Starter Code
### Code For CS3 Assignment 1 (Starter Code for Assignment 3)

This is all of the code needed for Assignment 1 and nothing extra. I have verified (on my machines at least) that this compiles with no errors or warnings under g++ [Apple LLVM version 7.3.0 (clang-703.0.31)] and Visual C++ [Visual Studio 2015]. That being said, this code is being provided **as is**.

I know it is kind of an eye sore to see all of the header files and cpp files all in one directory, but I know that many of you use different IDE's and environments. I figured that this would be the most universal way to present the code.

If you choose to use this code, attribute me when using any content from this repo. You are free to modify and redistribute my work as long as attribution continues.

Good luck on the next assignment!
